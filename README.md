# SIT210_Task11.2

This repository includes the two code files needed for the Project.

The file "Particle code" includes the code that should be run on the Particle Argon that is connected to the ultrasonic sensor. It will allow the argon to read the sensor data and send a message to the Raspberry Pi based on the readings. First flash this code on to the particle device connected to the ultrasonic sensor.

The file "Python code" includes the code that should be run on the Raspberry Pi with the buzzer connected to it. This code will be used to manipulate the buzzer based on a message sent by the Particle Argon. After making sure that the particle device was flashed with the "Particle code", run the "Python code" on the RPi.
