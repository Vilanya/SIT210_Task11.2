# SIT210_Task11.2

This repository includes the two code files needed for the Project.

The file "Python code" includes the code that should be run on the Raspberry Pi with the buzzer connected to it. This code will be used to manipulate the buzzer based on a message sent by the Particle Argon.

The file "Particle code" includes the code that should be run on the Particle Argon that is connected to the ultrasonic sensor. It will allow the argon to read the sensor data and send a message to the Raspberry Pi based on the readings.
